Hi Guys,
A simple guide to add barcodes to PDF templates in SuiteCRM, I would try the following steps:

* Download the PHP Barcode Generator library from GitHub (GitHub - picqer/php-barcode-generator: Barcode generator in PHP that is easy to use, non-bloated and framework independent. 1).

* Extract the downloaded archive and upload the “src” folder to your SuiteCRM instance in the custom directory. For example, you can upload it to custom/php-barcode-generator.

* Create a new PDF template or edit an existing one in SuiteCRM. You can do this by going to the “PDF Templates” section in the admin panel.

* In the PDF template editor, add a placeholder where you want to insert the barcode. You can do this by clicking on the “Add Field” button and selecting “Text” from the dropdown menu.

* In the “Text” field settings, enter a unique name for the field and select the “Variable” option for the “Type” field.

* In the “Variable Name” field, enter a unique name for the variable, such as “barcode”.

* Save the PDF template.

*Open the PHP file that generates the PDF, which is usually located in the custom/modules//views directory.

* Add the following code to the PHP file to generate the barcode:

### php code

    // Load the PHP Barcode Generator library
   require_once 'custom/php-barcode-generator/autoload.php';

   // Generate the barcode image
   $barcode = new Picqer\Barcode\BarcodeGeneratorPNG();
   $barcodeImage = $barcode->getBarcode('<barcode value>', $barcode::TYPE_CODE_128);

   // Add the barcode image to the PDF
   $pdf->Image('@'.$barcodeImage);
   Replace <barcode value> with the value you want to encode in the barcode.

Save the PHP file.

Run a Quick Repair and Rebuild in SuiteCRM to ensure that the new files are recognized.
After completing these steps, the PDF template should include a barcode image based on the value you specified.
